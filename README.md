# AWS-3-Tire-Architecture

**Procedure to Create a Simple Three-Tier Architecture on AWS:**

**1. Presentation Tier Setup:**

**Step 1:** Sign in to your AWS Management Console.
**Step 2:** Navigate to the Amazon S3 service.
**Step 3:** Create a new S3 bucket with a unique name.
**Step 4:** Upload your static web content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files) to the S3 bucket.
**Step 5:** Configure the bucket for static website hosting and note down the endpoint URL.
**Step 6:** Optionally, set up a custom domain using Amazon Route 53 and CloudFront for CDN distribution.

**2. Application Tier Setup:**

**Step 1:** Navigate to the Amazon EC2 service.
**Step 2:** Launch a new EC2 instance with your preferred operating system.
**Step 3:** Choose an instance type based on your application's requirements.
**Step 4:** Configure security groups to allow inbound traffic on necessary ports (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS).
**Step 5:** Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH or RDP.
**Step 6:** Install and configure your application server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx, Node.js).
**Step 7:** Deploy your application code to the server and ensure it's running correctly.
**Step 8:** Optionally, set up auto-scaling and load balancing using AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) for high availability.

**3. Data Tier Setup:**

**Step 1:** Choose the appropriate database service based on your application's requirements (e.g., Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB).
**Step 2:** Navigate to the chosen database service in the AWS Management Console.
**Step 3:** Create a new database instance or table according to your data model.
**Step 4:** Configure security settings and access permissions for the database.
**Step 5:** Import any existing data or populate the database with sample data.
**Step 6:** Ensure data backup and replication settings are configured for data durability.
**Step 7:** Integrate your application code with the database by updating connection strings or API endpoints.

**4. Integration and Testing:**

**Step 1:** Update the application code to fetch and display data from the database.
**Step 2:** Test the end-to-end functionality of your Three-Tier Architecture.
**Step 3:** Perform load testing to simulate real-world usage patterns and identify performance bottlenecks.
**Step 4:** Monitor system metrics using AWS CloudWatch or third-party monitoring tools.
**Step 5:** Implement optimizations and improvements based on testing results and monitoring data.

**5. Security and Compliance:**

**Step 1:** Review and enhance security measures for each tier, including network security, encryption, and access controls.
**Step 2:** Implement logging and auditing mechanisms to track system activity and detect potential security threats.
**Step 3:** Ensure compliance with industry regulations and best practices (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) by configuring appropriate security policies and controls.
**Step 4:** Regularly update and patch all components of the Three-Tier Architecture to address known vulnerabilities.

**6. Maintenance and Monitoring:**

**Step 1:** Establish a maintenance schedule for routine tasks such as software updates, database backups, and performance tuning.
**Step 2:** Continuously monitor system performance, resource utilization, and user feedback to identify areas for improvement.
**Step 3:** Set up automated alerts and notifications for critical events or performance anomalies.
**Step 4:** Conduct periodic reviews and assessments to ensure the Three-Tier Architecture meets evolving business requirements and performance goals.
